# `Death-Wallet`

> A Product that secures your crypto assets by giving you an option to choose Nominee of your assets and NFTs in case of any unlikely events like Death or Lost Wallet

🚀DEMO: https://death-wallet.netlify.app/

This Application is built on [react-moralis](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/react-moralis) and [Moralis](https://moralis.io?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=ethereum-boilerplate). Also has its own context provider for quick access to `chainId` or `ethAddress`

There are many components in this boilerplate that do not require an active web3 provider, they use Moralis Web3 API. Moralis supports the most popular blockchains and their test networks. You can find a list of all available networks in [Moralis Supported Chains](https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/web3-sdk/intro#supported-chains)

Please check the [official documentation of Moralis](https://docs.moralis.io/#user) for all the functionalities of Moralis.
